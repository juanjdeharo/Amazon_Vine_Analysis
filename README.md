### Total count of five-star non-vine reviews

> There is a total of 19,100 five-star non-vine reviews

### A total of 44% of Vine reviews were five-stars

### A total of 31% of non-vine reviews were five stars


## Summary
> It would seem to me that the amount of five-star Vine reviews is not significantly different enough to indicate a bias.
